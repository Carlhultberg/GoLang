# Task 1
1. By removing the go statement the program will not start a independent concurrent
go routine which will result in that no one receives Eva's messages. So the answer
is that the program will no be concurrent.
2. It will result in a simple deadlock.
3. Since the buffer size then becomes 0 there are no longer room for the person
who's unmatched. This will result in a deadlock.
4. Nothing will happen. The default case is for yourself to decide, if you
haven't specified what the default case should be the computer will use the standard
default case, which is sleep.
